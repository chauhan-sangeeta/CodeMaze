        Hint
You are given an integer array stations that represents the positions of the gas stations on the x-axis. You are also given an integer k.

You should add k new gas stations. You can add the stations anywhere on the x-axis, and not necessarily on an integer position.

        Let penalty() be the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations after adding the k new stations.

Return the smallest possible value of penalty(). Answers within 10-6 of the actual answer will be accepted.



        Example 1:

Input: stations = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], k = 9
Output: 0.50000
Example 2:

Input: stations = [23,24,36,39,46,56,57,65,84,98], k = 1
Output: 14.00000


Constraints:

        10 <= stations.length <= 2000
        0 <= stations[i] <= 108
stations is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
        1 <= k <= 106*/
