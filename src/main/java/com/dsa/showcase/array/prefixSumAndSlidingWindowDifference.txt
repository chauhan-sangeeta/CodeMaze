Rule of Thumb
Use prefix sum when:

You need to count something (e.g., number of subarrays)

The sum must be exact

You canâ€™t guarantee positive numbers (can manage negative numbers)

Use sliding window when:

The subarray is contiguous

You're tracking min/max window size or at most/at least conditions

The data is mostly positive
